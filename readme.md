What is SUC?
============
SUC: *simple universal citations*. SUC is meant to be a universal replacement for
*every* type of citation method out there. It is usable in readmes, code comments,
academic papers, etc, etc, *etc*.

Why?
----
Citations are a pain. They are a pain everyone in school and acadama has to deal with,
and they suck. They try to be simple, yet fail in every practical sense. An MLA citation
for a book is like `"this" (author, year of release date)`. This *may* have been practical
back in the day, when authors usually did not write more than one book per year. But with 
the advent of the internet, people can write blogs, articles, poems, anything, many
times per year. These systems are out of date, ugly, and not user friendly. And the
biggest problem, how are you supposed to sight something that isn't in a paper?
Should you be forced to use MLA formatting with its java tier syntax? Its stupidity.

DISCLAIMER:
-----------
There is probably similar citation methods out there, and you've probably seen
similar methods in some readmes. I DID NOT COME UP WITH THE MAJORITY OF THIS!
This is simply me putting together what i've seen and liked, while taking some
concepts logically futher, trying to stay as simple and elegant as possible.

SUC RULES
=========
CITATIONS: Citations in the paper, readme, etc, look like this `[7]`. Two square brackets,
with a number representing where in the citation list it can be found. The number
The number *can* represent when in the paper they are cited, but this can get
annoying when restructuring papers or readmes.

CITATION LIST: A citation list using SUC should look like this:

```
  [0] *citation*
  [1] *another citation*
  [2] *wow, another citation*
```

and should be at the end of a file or comment. This keeps it simple, readable,
and easy to find a certain citation. Want to find everywhere in a paper or
readme where source 2 is cited, and the citation itself? On modern browsers:
`ctrl+f -> [2]`. On vim-like editors: `/ -> [2]`. Its that simple.

How would I site X?
-------------------
Thats up to you. You *should* put all the information needed to find *what* you are citing.
For example, you would put the page number, book title, and author if you are qouting a book.
For a website, put the link. If it is a blog, paper, etc, put the author and release year.
If someone doesn't properly site something, or give enough information about what they are
citing, it isn't a credible source.

W-w-why would you leave it up to me?
------------------------------------
What? Are you not individually driven enough to judge for yourself if you're putting the right
amount of information in a citation? What? Do need everything to be made for you? Are you unable
to function in a system where everything isn't not only expliced, but forced? Are you scared you
wont be able internalise and force arbitrary rules onto others? (suc)k it up buttercup. I'm not
forcing you to use this, I'm not forcing you to cite a certain way. If its useful to you, good.
If not, gtfo, you aren't wanted here anyway.
